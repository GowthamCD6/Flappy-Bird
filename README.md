- **Jump Strength**: `-4.5` velocity on flap
- **Max Velocity**: `8` (terminal velocity cap)
- **Canvas Size**: 400 × 600 pixels
- **Bird Size**: 40 × 30 pixels

### Pipe System
- **Pipe Width**: 70px
- **Gap Size**: 160px
- **Pipe Speed**: 2px/frame (boosted to 5 during Power mode)
- **Spawn Interval**: Every 1800ms
- **Collision**: AABB-based detection
- Individual pipe halves (top/bottom) can be independently destroyed by shields

### Scoring
- **+1 point** per pipe passed
- **×2 multiplier** while in the portal's Space World
- Score displayed using sprite number images for pixel-perfect rendering

### Medals
| Medal | Score Range |
|---|---|
| 🥉 Bronze | 0 – 10 |
| 🥈 Silver | 11 – 20 |
| 🥇 Gold | 21+ |

### Death Animations
| Type | Trigger | Animation |
|---|---|---|
| **Normal Death** | Pipe or ground collision | Bounce up (velocity = -7) → pause → gravity fall off screen |
| **Rocket Blast** | Rocket collision | 500ms explosion sprite → then death fall |
| **Screen Shake** | Any death | 8px/300ms (pipe), 15px/400ms (rocket) |
| **Hit Flash** | Any death | White screen flash overlay |

## ⚡ Power-Up System

All powers are purchased from the Shop as consumable quantities. Using a power decrements your owned count by 1.

### Power Boost
- **Cost**: 15 coins (shop)
- **Duration**: 5 seconds
- **Effect**: Bird locks at current Y position, becomes invincible, pipe speed increases to 5
- **Visuals**: Gold/orange particle trail, radial glow, gradient timer bar at top

### Shield
- **Cost**: 20 coins (shop)
- **Duration**: Until 3 hits are absorbed
- **Effect**: Absorbs pipe collisions and destroys the colliding pipe half
- **Health States**:
  - 🔵 Blue — 3 hits remaining
  - 🟡 Yellow — 2 hits remaining
  - 🔴 Red — 1 hit remaining
- **Visuals**: Orbiting particles, pulsing bubble, rotating dashed ring, health bar, pipe break debris particles
- **Cooldown**: 2 seconds after breaking

### Anti-Rocket (Gravity)
- **Cost**: 10 coins (shop)
- **Activation**: Instant
- **Effect**: All active rockets receive downward gravity — they tumble and fall to the ground
- **Visuals**: 3 expanding purple/violet gravity wave rings, ground explosions with debris
- **Cooldown**: 10 seconds

---

## 🌀 Portal & Space World

### Portal Mechanics
- **First Trigger**: Score reaches 30
- **Subsequent Portals**: Every +30 points after returning (or +15 if previous portal was missed)
- **Pre-loading**: Portal is pre-loaded at game init for instant appearance — no spawn delay
- **Entry Timer**: 20-second window to fly into the portal

### Portal Transition Sequence
1. **Entry Portal Appears** — right side of screen with pulsing glow
2. **Suck-In Animation** (1.5s) — bird spirals toward portal center, shrinks, rotates, stretches (spaghettification effect), screen darkens, vortex particles
3. **World Transition** (1.2s) — circle-reveal wipe effect from portal center, white flash at midpoint, background cross-fade
4. **Space World** (20s) — zero-gravity coin collection mini-game
5. **Exit Portal** — appears after 20 seconds, same suck-in animation
6. **Return** — 3-second grace period (no pipes), 3-second invincibility (flashing), autopilot mode

### Space World Mini-Game
- **Controls**: Smooth floating movement (up/down), no flap-based gravity
- **Coin Patterns** (5 types):
  - `line` — horizontal row
  - `arc` — curved path
  - `zigzag` — zigzag formation
  - `diamond` — 8-coin diamond shape
  - `wave` — sine wave curve
- **Coin Speed**: 3px/frame, new pattern every 800ms
- **Score/Coins**: ×2 multiplier on all scoring; each collected coin adds to main balance
- **Background**: Scrolling `space.jpg` with parallax, alien ground with crystal formations

---

## 🚀 Rocket & Gravity System

### Rocket Waves
- **First Wave**: Score 10
- **Subsequent Waves**: Every +10 score points
- **Formation**: 3 rockets per formation, 3 formations per wave, staggered positions
- **Rocket Speed**: 1.5 – 2.5px/frame (random)
- **Warning**: 800ms flashing red triangle + "!" indicator before rocket enters screen
- **Gaps**: Upper/lower gap positions for the bird to dodge through
- **Explosion**: Shockwave ring + 20 fire particles + 6 smoke particles + screen flash

### Gravity Power (Anti-Rocket)
- Activated instantly — sends out purple gravity wave rings
- All rockets gain downward physics: initial upward bounce → gravity acceleration (0.6) → tumbling rotation → ground impact
- Ground explosions with blast sprite, debris, smoke, and shockwave

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Engine**: Vanilla HTML5 Canvas 2D — no libraries or frameworks
- **Canvas Resolution**: 400 × 600 pixels (internal), scaled to fit viewport
- **Rendering**: `requestAnimationFrame` game loop with delta-time
- **Pixel Art**: `imageSmoothingEnabled = false` + CSS `image-rendering: pixelated`
- **Fallback Rendering**: Every visual element has a procedural fallback if sprites fail to load
- **State Machine**: `start` → `ready` → `playing` → `dying`/`blasting` → `gameOver`
- **Performance**: Debounced localStorage writes, particle count limits, pre-loaded portal sprites
